Welcome to the **Digital Subcurrent**! This project is an engaging puzzle game designed to test your problem-solving skills while introducing core information system concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## 🕹️ Overview

This puzzle game features a series of levels where players must navigate their character through challenging environments, collect key items, and unlock the exit. Each level introduces unique mechanics inspired by information system concepts such as instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execution (EX), memory (MEM), and write back (WB).

### Core Features:
- **Dynamic Transition System**: Enjoy smooth level transitions with progress indicators, black screen fades, and animated text.
- **Unique Puzzle Mechanics**: Each level has its own distinctive gameplay challenges.
- **Interactive Story Elements**: Collect Keycodes and interact with Terminals to progress through the game.

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

### Key Elements:
1. **Keycodes and Terminals**: Collect Keycodes to unlock Terminals, which open the exit.
2. **Boxes**: Pushable obstacles that can block your path or lead to failure if Keycodes are lost.
3. **Player and Object Movements**: Time progresses based on your steps, and some obstacles may move dynamically.

### Game Rules:
1. Push boxes to create a clear path but avoid losing Keycodes.
2. Collect all necessary Keycodes to unlock the Terminal.
3. Move efficiently to minimize wasted steps.
